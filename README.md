# Deprecation Notice

The preferred method of running TerminusDB locally is by using `docker compose`. The Docker image can be used to run TerminusDB
on servers whereas the docker compose is the preferred method of running TerminusDB and its TerminusCMS components locally.

> Script for running TerminusDB with Docker.

[**TerminusDB**][terminusdb] is an [open-source][terminusdb-repo] graph database
and document store. It allows you to link JSON documents in a powerful knowledge
graph all through a simple document API.

[terminusdb]: https://terminusdb.com/
[terminusdb-repo]: https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb

In case you don't want to run TerminusDB yourself, try out **TerminusX**, a
hosted data platform, built on TerminusDB, that allows you to build, deploy,
execute, monitor, and share versioned data products. TerminusX is in public beta
and you can [sign up now][dashboard].

## Prerequisites

### Docker

Since this script uses the TerminusDB Docker container, you need to have Docker
running.

On Windows and Mac, Docker Desktop can be downloaded here:
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

Note that on Windows, the default memory allowed for Docker is 2GB. Since this
is an in-memory database, bigger databases require more memory. Therefore
raise the default allowed memory usage to a higher value in the Docker Desktop
settings.

On Linux, use your distro's package manager, or find more information here:
https://www.docker.com/products/container-runtime

### Git

This script is distributed via GitHub, so you will need git to clone and update
it, if you don't already have git, you can download it here:
https://git-scm.com/downloads

Windows users should use the application "Git Bash" for all terminal commands
described below, this application comes with Git for Windows.

### Sudo

Sudo is optional. As letting unprivileged users run docker is insecure, this
script uses sudo by default if it is available. 

Most users will not need to do anything here, sudo is installed by default on
Macs and many populer Linux distros such as Fedora, Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu and
Mint. Linux users who use minmal distros such as Archlinux, are advised to
install sudo and confugure their sudoers file accordingly.

Windows users do not need to do anything here.

## Installing

### Get this repo, cd to it

```
git clone https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-bootstrap
cd terminusdb-bootstrap
```

### Run the container by using the script (the first time)

```
./terminusdb-container run

Unable to find image 'terminusdb/terminusdb-server:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from terminusdb/terminusdb-server
8f91359f1fff: Pulling fs layer
939634dec138: Pulling fs layer

[ ... ]
```

#### If you've installed before

You may need to remove previous volumes or you may encounter bugs or
the old console.

Warning: This will lead to losing local data.

```
 ./terminusdb-container rm

This will delete storage volume
Are you sure? [y/N] y
```

### To stop, attach, etc, see usage
```
./terminusdb-container 

USAGE:
  terminusdb-container [COMMAND]

  help        show usage
  run         run container
  cli         use the terminusdb cli
  stop        stop container
  attach      attach to prolog shell
  exec        execute a command inside the container
  rm          remove volumes
```

That's it! You're ready to go!

# Using The Enviroment

This script is designed to "work out of the box," however, there may be
situations where advanced users want to override some of it's defaults, this is
done by setting enviroment variables.

## Security

To prevent accidental insecure deployments, the Docker container binds to the
IP 127.0.0.1 and therefore the server will only be accessible on the local
machine, and not from any other machine over the network.

If you would like to deploy to a server, you will need to enable HTTPS by
putting TerminusDB behind a reverse proxy.

## `ENV` File

The script sources a file called `ENV` if it is found in the current directory.
See [`ENV.example`] for examples of the environment variables that can be set.

[`ENV.example`]: ./ENV.example

To have environment variables set every time you run `./terminusdb-container`,
follow these steps:

1. Copy `ENV.example` to `ENV`.
2. Edit `ENV`: uncomment the lines you want to change and set the values.
